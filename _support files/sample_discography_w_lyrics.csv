1984,From Her To Eternity,1,Avalanche,y,"I stepped into an avalanche
It covered up my soul
When I am not this hunchback that you see
I sleep beneath the golden hill
You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn to serve me well
You strike my side by accident
As you go down to your goal
This cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold
He does not ask for your company
Not at the centre, the centre of the world
I who am on a pedestal
You did not raise me there
Your laws do not compel me now
To kneel grotesque and bare
For I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare
You who wish to conquer pain
You must learn what makes me kind
The crumbs of love that you offer me
Are the crumbs I've left behind
Your pain is no credential here
It's just a shadow of my wound
I have begun to ask for you
I who have no greed
I have begun to long for you
I who have no need
You say you've gone away from me
But I can feel you when you breathe
Do not dress in those rags for me
I know you are not poor
And do not love me quite so fiercely now
When you know that you are not sure
It is your turn, my beloved one
It is your flesh that I wear",I stepped into an avalanche It covered up my soul When I am not this hunchback that you see I sleep beneath the golden hill You who wish to conquer pain You must learn to serve me well You strike my side by accident As you go down to your goal This cripple here that you clothe and feed Is neither starved nor cold He does not ask for your company Not at the centre the centre of the world I who am on a pedestal You did not raise me there Your laws do not compel me now To kneel grotesque and bare For I myself am the pedestal For this ugly hump at which you stare You who wish to conquer pain You must learn what makes me kind The crumbs of love that you offer me Are the crumbs I've left behind Your pain is no credential here It's just a shadow of my wound I have begun to ask for you I who have no greed I have begun to long for you I who have no need You say you've gone away from me But I can feel you when you breathe Do not dress in those rags for me I know you are not poor And do not love me quite so fiercely now When you know that you are not sure It is your turn my beloved one It is your flesh that I wear,136
1984,From Her To Eternity,2,Cabin Fever!,y,"The Captain's fore-arm like bunched-up rope
With A-N-I-T-A wriggling free on a skull'n'dagger
And a portrait of Christ, nailed to an anchor
Etched into his upper...

O o o' Cabin Fever!
O o o' Cabin Fever!

Slams his fucking tin-dish down
Our Captain, takes time to crush
Some Bloo-Bottles glowin in his gruel
With a lump in his throat, and lumpy mush
Thumbing a scrapbook stuck up with clag
And a morbid lump of Love in his flags
Done is the Missing, now all that remain
Is to sail forever, upon the stain

Cabin Fever! O o o' Cabin Fever!

The captains free-hand is a cleaver
Which he fashions his beard, and he rations his jerky!
And carves his peg outta the finest mahogany!
Or was it Ebony?
Tallies up his loneliness, notch by notch
'Cause the sea offers nothing to hold or touch
Notch by notch, winter by winter
Notch by notch, winter by winter
Now his leg is whittled, right down to a splinter

O o Cabin Fever! O o o Cabin Fever!
O the rollin sea keeps rollin on!
O the rollin sea keeps rollin on!
She's everywhere! now that she's gone!
She's everywhere! now that she's gone! Gone! Gone!

1984,From Her To Eternity,4,From Her To Eternity,y,"Ah wanna tell ya 'bout a girl
You know, she lives in apt. 29
Why? That's the one right up top a mine
I start to cry, I start to cry

All through this lonesome night
And I hear her crying too

Leaking through the cracks
Down upon my face
I catch 'em in my mouth!

Scrutinizing every little piece of dirt
Tore out a page and stuffed it inside my shirt
Fled outta the window
And shinning it down the vine
Outta her nightmare
And back into mine

From her to eternity!

She's wearing them bloo-stockens, I bet!

But I can hear the most melancholy sound I ever heard!
Walk and cry, kneel and cry!

From her to eternity!
From her to eternity!

Oh tell me why? Why? Why?
Why the ceiling still shakes?
Why the fixtures turn to serpents snakes?
This desire to possess her is a wound

Is, therefore, not to desire her

1984,From Her To Eternity,5,Saint Huck,y,"Born of the river
Born of its ever-changing, never-changing murky water
Oh riverboat just rollin' along through the great great greasy city
Huck standing like a Saint, upon its deck
If ya wanna catch a Saint
Then bait ya hook, let's take a walk...

'O come to me!, O come to me!' is what the dirty city
Say to Huck... HUCK
Woah-woah, woah woah!
Woah-woah, woah woah!
Saint Huck! Huck!

Straight in the arms of the city goes Huck
Down the beckonin' streets of opportunity
Whistling his favorite river-song...
And a bad-blind nigga at the piano
Buts a sinister blooo lilt into that sing-a-long
Huck senses something's wrong!
Sirens wail in the city
And lil-Ulysses turn to putty
And Ol' Man River's got a bone to pick!
And our boy's hardly got a bone to suck!

He go, woah-woah, woah woah!
Woah-woah, woah woah!
Saint Huck! Huck!

The mo-o-o-on, its huge cycloptic eye
Watches the city streets contract
Twist and cripple and crack
Saint Huck goes on a dog's-leg now
Saint Huck goes on a dog's-leg now
You know the story!
Ya wake up one morning and you find you're a thug
Blowing smoke rings in some dive
Ya fingers hot and itching, ya cracking ya knuckles
Ya bull neck bristling...
Still Huck he ventures on whistling
And Death reckons Huckleberry's time is up

O woah woah woah!
Saint Huck!
O woah woah woah!
Saint Huck! Huck!

Yonder go Huck, minus pocket-watch an' wallet gone
Skin shrink-wraps his skeleton
No wonder he gets thinner, what with his cold'n'skinny dinners!
Saint Huck-a-Saint Elvis, Saint Huck-a-Saint Elvis
O you recall the song ya used to sing-a-long
Shifting the river-trade on that ol' steamer
Life is but a dream!
But ya traded in the Mighty ol' man River
For the Dirty ol' Man Latrine!
The brothel shift
The hustle'n'the bustle and the green-backs rustle
And all the sexy-cash
And the randy-cars
And the two dollar fucks
O o o ya outta luck, ya outta luck

Woah-woah-woah-woah
Saint Huck! Huck!

This is the track of deception
Leads to the heart of despair
Huck whistles like he just don't care
But in the pocket of the jacket is a chamber
Lead pellets sleeps in there
Wake Up!
Now Huck whistles and he kneels
And he lays down there
See ya Huck, good luck
A smoke ring hovers above his head
And the rats and the dogs and the men all come
And put a bullet through his eye
And the drip and the drip and the drip of the Mississippi cryin'
And Saint Huck hears his own Mississippi just rollin' by him Woah-woah-

Ah'm enquirin' on behalf of his soul
Ah'd be beholdin to ya all
For a lil information just a little indication
Just who'll dig the hole?
When ya done ransackin' his room
Grabbin' any damn thing that shines
Throw the scraps down on the street
Like all his books and his notes
All his books and his notes and
All the junk that he wrote
The whole fuckin' lot right up in smoke
Ain't there nothing sacred anymore
Won't someone build a box for black paul?
And their shootin' off his guns
And their shootin' off their mouths
Saying ""fuck with us and die!""
""Fuck with us and die!""

""Cover that eye, cover that frozen eye!""

Black-puppetin' a heap up against the stoning-wall
Black-puppet go to sleep
Ma-ma won't scold ya anymore
Armies of ants wade up the lil red streams
They're headin' for the mother-pool
O lord it's cruel! o man it's hot! o man it's hot and
And some of them ants they just climb to the spot
Who threw the first stone at black Paul?

The pen-pushers and the quacks

And built the box...
Here is the shovel that dug the hole
In this ground of rocks...

Is made out of stone-lies

An axe in thee

Brick of grief and stricken morter
With this ring
This silver hoop of wire
I bind your maiden mainstem
Just to keep you as a child

The very minute that I leave

O say goodbye to the little girl tree
O Lord you know that I must say goodbye
To that little girl tree
I rise up her girl-child lumps and slipping knots
Into her laden boughs
And amongst her roping limbs
Like a swollen neck vein branching
Into smaller lesser veins
That must all just sing and say goodbye
And let her blossom veils fly
Her velvet gown
Down down down
Down down down
Down down down and goodbye
For you know that I must say goodbye

To a rhythm softly tortured
Of a motion back and forth
That's a rhythm sweetly tortured
O that's the rhythm of the orchard

1986,Your Funeral ... My Trial,1,Sad Waters,y,"Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
We go down to the river where the willows weep
Take a naked root for a lovers seat
That rose out of the bitten soil
But sound to the ground by creeping ivy coils

And I don't know right from wrong
Forever a hostage of your child's world

And then I ran my tin-cup heart along
The prison of her ribs
And with a toss of her curls
That little girl goes wading in
Rollin her dress up past her knee
Turning these waters into wine
Then she platted all the willow vines

1986,Your Funeral ... My Trial,2,The Carny,y,"And no-one saw the carny go
And the weeks flew by
Until they moved on the show
Leaving his caravan behind
It was parked out on the south east ridge
And as the company crossed the bridge
With the first rain filling the bone-dry river bed
It shone, just so, upon the edge
Away, away, we're sad, they said

Dog-boy, atlas, mandrake, the geeks, the hired hands
There was not one among them that did not cast an eye behind
In the hope that the carny would return to his own kind
The carny left behind a horse, all skin and bone
That he named ""Sorrow""
And it was a shallow, unmarked grave
That that old nag was laid
In the then parched meadow

And it was the Dwarves that were given the task of digging the ditch
And laying the nag's carcass in the ground
While boss Bellini, waved his smoking pistol around
Saying, ""The nag is dead meat""
""We can't afford to carry dead weight""
While the whole company, standing about
Not making a sound
And turning to the Dwarves perched on the enclosure gate
The boss says, ""Bury this lump of crow bait""

And the rain came hammering down
Everybody running for their wagons
Tying all the canvas flaps down
The mangy cats growling in their cages
The bird-girl flapping and squawking in the round
The whole valley reeking of wet beast
Wet beast and rotten, sodden hay
Freak and brute creation
All packed up and on their way

The three Dwarves peering from their wagon's hind
Moses says to Noah, ""We shoulda dugga deepa one""
Their grizzled faces like dying moons
Still dirty from the digging done
And Charlie, the eldest of the three, said
""I guess the carny ain't gonna show""
And they were silent for a spell
Wishing they'd done a better job of burying Sorrow

And the company passed from the valley
Into a higher ground
The rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow
And on the mound
Until nothing was left, nothing left at all
Except the body of Sorrow
That rose in time
To float upon the surface of the eaten soil

And a murder of crows did circle round
First one, then the others flapping blackly down
And the carny's van still sat upon the edge
Tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge

And no-one saw the carny go
I say it's funny how things go",And no-one saw the carny go And the weeks flew by Until they moved on the show Leaving his caravan behind It was parked out on the south east ridge And as the company crossed the bridge With the first rain filling the bone-dry river bed It shone just so upon the edge Away away we're sad they said Dog-boy atlas mandrake the geeks the hired hands There was not one among them that did not cast an eye behind In the hope that the carny would return to his own kind The carny left behind a horse all skin and bone That he named Sorrow And it was a shallow unmarked grave That that old nag was laid In the then parched meadow And it was the Dwarves that were given the task of digging the ditch And laying the nag's carcass in the ground While boss Bellini waved his smoking pistol around Saying The nag is dead meat We can't afford to carry dead weight While the whole company standing about Not making a sound And turning to the Dwarves perched on the enclosure gate The boss says Bury this lump of crow bait And the rain came hammering down Everybody running for their wagons Tying all the canvas flaps down The mangy cats growling in their cages The bird-girl flapping and squawking in the round The whole valley reeking of wet beast Wet beast and rotten sodden hay Freak and brute creation All packed up and on their way The three Dwarves peering from their wagon's hind Moses says to Noah We shoulda dugga deepa one Their grizzled faces like dying moons Still dirty from the digging done And Charlie the eldest of the three said I guess the carny ain't gonna show And they were silent for a spell Wishing they'd done a better job of burying Sorrow And the company passed from the valley Into a higher ground The rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow And on the mound Until nothing was left nothing left at all Except the body of Sorrow That rose in time To float upon the surface of the eaten soil And a murder of crows did circle round First one then the others flapping blackly down And the carny's van still sat upon the edge Tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge And the rain it hammered down And no-one saw the carny go I say it's funny how things go,238

Jack wept and kissed his shadow ""Goodbye""
Spat from their dirty dungeons
Into a fully different din
Shat from their institutions
Into a truly different din
And his shadow soon became a wife
And children plagued his latter life
Until one night he took a skinning knife
And stole into the town
And Jack tracked his shadow down

Said the shadow to Jack Henry
""Oh what's wrong?""
Jack said ""A home is not a hole""
""And shadow, you're just a gallows that I hang my body from""
""Oh Shadow, you're a shackle from which my time is never done""

And put me in Death Row
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know
And I'll say it again
I am not afraid to die

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood

And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this measuring of proof
Of An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth

A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog
The walls are bad
Black, bottom kind
They are the sick breath at my hind
They are the sick breath at my hind
They are the sick breath at my hind
They are the sick breath gathering at my hind

I hear stories from the chamber
How Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
Died upon the cross
And might I say it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told

Like my good hand I
Tatooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist

In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
A throne from which I'm told
All history does unfold
Down here it's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away

Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
And like the moth that tries
To enter the bright eye
So I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied

My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D
'Tis a long-suffering shackle
Collaring all that rebel blood

What a wretched life
I was born on the day
That my poor mamma died
I was cut from her belly
With a Stanley knife
My daddy did a jig
With the drunk midwife

Who's that yonder all in flames
Dragging behind him a sack of chains
Who's that yonder all in flames
Up jumped the Devil and he staked his claim on me

Oh poor heart
I was doomed from the start
Doomed to play
The villain's part
I was the baddest Johnny
In the apple cart
My blood was blacker
Than the chambers of a dead nun's heart

Who's that milling round the courthouse steps?
Nailing my face to the hitching fence
Who's that milling round the courthouse steps?
Up jumped the Devil and off we crept

Oh no, oh no
Where could I go
With my hump of trouble
And my sack of woe?
To the digs and deserts of Mexico
Where my neck was safe from the lynching rope

Like I was the brunt of some hilarity
Who's that yonder laughing at me?
Well, up jumped the Devil, one, two, three

Ha-ha ha ha ha
How lucky we were
We hit the cathouse
And sampled their wares
We got as drunk
As a couple of Czars
That night I swatted
My lucky star

Who's that dancing on the jailhouse roof?
Stamping on the ramping with a cloven hoof
Who's that dancing on the jailhouse roof?
Up jumped the Devil and said ""Here is your man, I got proof""

Oh no, oh no, don't go
Oh slow down Joe
The righteous path
Is straight as an arrow
Take a walk
And you'll find it's too narrow
Too narrow for the likes of me

His eyes are hollow but he looks like me
Now, who's that swinging from the gallow tree?

1988,Tender Prey,4,Watching Alice,y,"Alice wakes
It is morning
She is yawning
As she walks about the room
Her hair rolls down her breast
She is naked and it is June

Standing at the window
I wonder if she knows that I can see
Watching Alice rise year after year
Up in her palace, she's captive there

Alice's body
Is golden brown
Her hair hangs down
As she brushes it one hundred times
First she pulls her stockings on
And then the church bell chimes
Alice climbs into her uniform
The zippers on the side
Watching Alice dressing in her room
It's so depressing, it's cruel
Watching Alice dressing in her room
It's so depressing, it's true",Alice wakes It is morning She is yawning As she walks about the room Her hair rolls down her breast She is naked and it is June Standing at the window I wonder if she knows that I can see Watching Alice rise year after year Up in her palace she's captive there Alice's body Is golden brown Her hair hangs down As she brushes it one hundred times First she pulls her stockings on And then the church bell chimes Alice climbs into her uniform The zippers on the side Watching Alice dressing in her room It's so depressing it's cruel Watching Alice dressing in her room It's so depressing it's true,75
1988,Tender Prey,5,Mercy,y,"I stood in the water
In the middle month of winter
My camel skin was torture
I was in a state of nature
The wind, sir, it was wicked
And I was so alone
And just as I predicted
My followers were gone

I cried 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I got down on my knees
Crying 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I got down on my knees

Thrown into a dungeon
Bread and water was my portion
And faith - my only weapon
To rest the devil's legion
The speak-hole would slide open
A viper's voice would plead
A voice thick with innuendo
Syphilis and Greed

And she cried 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
I told her to get down on her knees
Crying 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy upon me (Mercy on me)
I told her to get down on her knees

In a garden full of roses
My hands were tied behind me
My cousin was working miracles
I wondered if he'd find me
The moon faced toward me
Like a platter made of gold
My death, it almost bored me
So often was it told

And I cried 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I dropped down to my knees (To my knees)
And I cried 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And it put me to my knees (To my knees)
Mercy (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I dropped down on my knees (On my knees)
Crying 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Yeah, have mercy on me (Mercy on me)

1988,Tender Prey,7,Slowly Goes The Night,y,"Darling, that morning you chose to go
I woke in my boots and clothes
You dig in my cards, stole all my cash
Even my 500 dollar suit was slashed
And I just lay there watching the sun fall down from the sky
Not wanting to open the letter
But opening it anyway
And seeing those two words

Lover, lover, goodbye
So slowly goes the night
Next to me lies your body
Playing like a map of some forbidden land
And I trace the ghost of your bones with my trembling hand
Dark is my night
And darker is my day
Yeah
I must have been blind, out of my mind
I never never saw the warning sign
How goes it?
It goes lonely
It goes slowly

So slowly goes the night
Ten lonely days ten lonely nights
Come
I watch the moon get flayed each night
Till the moon becomes the skinning knife
The skins of my sins I send to cover and comfort you
I know of a heaven
But honey, I know of a hell
Yeah
I hang my head
I toss in my bed
I never never forget the words you said
One evening ""I'm leaving""
And I laughed and checked her breathing
And said darling
""Go slowly through the night""

O baby I feel the heal of time
And it hurts
I wake to find you sitting right there
Cutting tangles out of your hair
Singing a song that's all wrong
Hey, but that's all right, I don't care
Darling I'm sorry
For all your misery
Yeah
I reach out and embrace
An empty space
A song that slowly slowly fades
Where goes it?
It goes someplace
It goes somewhere where it's lonely

And black as the night
Come on home, lets put things right
Put things right
I hang my head and cry, cry, cry
Darling all night I try
To seize on a reason for this mad, mad season
The nights they are so long now
I can't remember them being light
Call it sleep, call it death, call it what you like
But only sleep, only sleep brings you back to life
Yeah
I hang my head
I toss and I sweat
I never, never, never can forget
How goes it?
Well I'm going

With banners of fire

Awash with the dawning
And a voice came so brightly
I covered my eyes

1990,The Good Son,6,The Hammer Song,,"I set out on Monday
The night was cold and vast
And my brother slept
And though I left quite quietly
My father raged and raged
And my mother wept
Now, my life was like a river
All sucked into the ground

And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down

Many miles did I roam
Through the ice and through the snow
My horse died on the seventh day
I stumbled into a city
Where the people tried to kill me
And I ran in shame
Then I came upon a river
And I laid my saddle down

And then the hammer came down
Lord, the hammer came down
It knocked me to the ground
And I said now, ""Please, please
Take me back to my home ground""
Lord, the hammer came down

Now, I've been made weak by visions
For many visions did I see
All through the night
In the seventh hour an angel came
With many snakes in all his hands
And I fled in fright
I pushed off into the river
And the waters came around

1992,Henry's Dream,1,"Papa Won't Leave You, Henry",,"I went out walking the other day
The heat hung wet around my neck
My head it rung with screams and groans
From the night I spent amongst her bones
And I passed beside the mission house
Where that mad old buzzard, the reverend
Shrieked and flapped about life after your dead
Well, I thought about my friend, Michel
How they rolled him in linoleum
And shot him in the neck
A bloody halo, like a think-bubble
Circling his head
And I bellowed at the firmament
Looks like the rains are here to stay
And the rain pissed down upon me
And washed me all away
Saying:

Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Well, the road is long
And the road is hard
And a many fall by the side
But Papa won't leave you, Henry
So there ain't no need to cry

And I went on down the road
(He went on down the road)
Oh yeah, I went on down the road
(He went on down the road)

Well, the moon it looked exhausted
Like something you should pity
Spent an age spotted
Above the sizzling wires of the city
Well, it reminded me of her face
And her bleached and hungry eyes
Her hair was like a curtain
Falling open with the laughter
And closing with the lies
And the ghost of her still lingers on
Though she's passed through me
And is gone
Well the slum dogs, they are barking
And the rain children on the streets
And the tears that we will weep today
Will all be washed away
By the tears we weep today, we'll weep again tomorrow

Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy

And I went on down the road
(He went on down the road)
Oh yeah, I went on down the road
(He went on down the road)

And I came upon a little house
A little house upon a hill
And I entered through and the curtain hissed
Into the house with its blood-red bowels
Where wet-lipped women with greasy fists
Crawled the ceilings and the walls
And they filled me full of drink
And they led me round the rooms
Naked and cold and grinning
Until everything went black
And I came down spinning
I awoke so drunk and full of rage
That I could hardly speak
A fag in a whalebone corset
Draping his dick across my cheek
Well its into the shame
And its into a guilt
And its into the fucking fray
And the walls ran red around me
A warm arterial spray
Saying:

Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Well, the night is dark
And the night is deep
And its jaws are open wide
Yeah well, Papa won't leave you, Henry
So there ain't no need to cry

And I went on down the road
(He went on down the road)
Oh yeah,I went on down the road
(He went on down the road)
Yeah, woah, woah  (woah, woah, woah, woah)

It's the rainy season where I'm living
Death comes leaping out of every doorway
Wasting you for money, for your clothes
And for your nothing
Entire towns being washed away
Favelas exploding on inflammable spillways
And the lynch-mobs, death squads, babies being born without brains
The mad heats and the relentless rains
Well if you stick your arm into that hole
It comes out sheared off to the bone
And with her kisses bubbling on my lips
I swiped the rain and nearly missed
And then I went on down the road
(He went on down the road)

Papa won't leave you, Henry
Papa won't leave you, Boy
Papa won't leave you, Henry

And I haven't got a penny
For to buy no more whiskey
I have to go home
Oh brother, my cup is empty

For to buy no more whiskey

I am the captain of my pain
Tis the bit, the bridle
The thrashing cane
The stirrup, the harness
And he whipping mane
The pickled eye
And the shrinking brain
Brother, buy me one more drink
Explain the nature of my pity
Yes, let me tell you once again
I am the captain of my pain

I cannot blame it all on her
To blame her all would be a lie
For many a night I lay awake
And wished that I could watch her die
See her accusing finger spurt
See flies swarm her hateful eye
To watch her groaning in the dirt
See her clicking tongue crack dry
Brother, buy me one more drink
One more drink and then goodbye
And do not mock me when I say
Let's drink one more before I die

Brother, my cup is empty

I've been swinging from the stars
This wretch in beggars clothing
Bangs his cup across the bars
Look, this cup of mine is empty!
Seems I've misplaced my desires
Seems I'm sweeping up the ashes
Of all my former fires

And fill this tiny cup of mine
And please, sir, make it whiskey

And counted only one
One tiny little blessing

Throw a dollar onto the bar

1992,Henry's Dream,5,Christina The Astonishing,,"Christina the Astonishing lived a long, long time ago
She was stricken with a seizure
At the age of twenty-two
They took her body in a coffin
To a tiny church in Liege
Where she sprang up from the coffin
Just after the Agnus Dei
She soared up to the rafters
Perched on a beam up there
Cried ""The stink of human sin, the stink of human sin, the stink is more that I can bear""

And I said oh

Christina the Astonishing
Was the most astonishing of all
She prayed balanced on a hurdle
Or curled up into a ball
She fled to remote places
Climbed towers and trees and walls
To escape the stench of corruption
The stench of human corruption
Into an oven she did crawl

And I said oh

Behaved in a terrifying way
She would run wildly through the streets
Jump in the Meuse and swim away

All the people gathered round
They bought me drinks

And in that light
Their faces leer at me
How I wish they'd just let me be

Their favours were for free
Now even the doors of the whores of this town
Are closed to me

Why the people of this town
Have washed their hands of me

Goddamn the day that I was born
And the night that forced me from the womb

1992,Henry's Dream,7,John Finns' Wife,,"Well the night was deep and the night was dark
And I was at the old dance-hall on the edge of town
Some big ceremony was going down
Well, dancers writhed and squirmed and then
Came apart and then writhed again
Like squirming flies on a pin
In the heat and in the din
In the heat and in the din
I fell to thinking about brand new wife of mad John Finn

Well, a midnight came and a clock did strike
And in she came, and did John Finn's wife
With legs like scissors and butcher's knives
Tattooed breast and flaming eyes
And a crimson carnation in her teeth
Carving her way through the dance floor
And I'm standing over by the bandstand
Every eye gaping on John Finn's wife
Every eye gaping on John Finn's wife

Now, John Finn's wife was something of a mystery
In a town where to share a sworn secret was a solemn duty
I had brass knuckles and a bolo knife
Over near the bandstand with John Finn's wife
She got perfumed breasts and raven hair
Sprinkled with wedding confettis
And a gang of garrotters were all giving me stares
Armed, as they were, with machetes
Well the night through the window was full of lights
Winking and awatching at John Finns' wife
Winking and awatching at John Finns' wife

Well next came the cops, all out on the town
But it don't look like no trouble there
As they head for the bar in their lumpy suits
I slip my hand between the thighs of John Finn's wife
They seemed to yawn awake, her things
It was a warm and very ferocious night
And the moon full of blood and light
And my eyes grew small and my eyes grew tight
As I plotted in the ear of John Finns' wife

Enter John Finn in his shrunken suit
With his quick black eyes and black cheroot
With his filed-down teeth and a hobnail boot
His fists full of pistols in his pockets
Aiming at me and aiming at his wife
The band fall silent all fearing for their lives
And with fear in my guts like tangled twine
Cause all I got is brass knuckles and a bolo knife
And mad John Finns' wife is all
And the three of us walk out of the hall

Now the night bore down upon us all
You could hear the crickets in the thickets call
Guns did flare and guns did bawl
And I planted my bolo knife in the neck
Of mad John Finn. I took his wretched life
Now I'm over near the bandstand
Every hand moving on John Finns' wife
Every hand moving on John Finns' wife

And John Finns' wife
Took all the flowers down
From her hair
And threw them on the ground
And the flies did hum
And the flies did buzz around
Poor John Finn
Lying dead upon the ground

1992,Henry's Dream,8,Loom Of The Land,,"It was the dirty end of winter
Along the loom of the land
When I walked with sweet Sally
Hand upon hand
And the wind it bit bitter
For a boy of no means
With no shoes on his feet
And a knife in his jeans
Along the loom of the land
The mission bells pealed
From the tower at Saint Mary's
Down to Reprobate Fields
And I saw that the world
Was all blessed and bright
And Sally breathed softly
In the majestic night

Oh baby please don't cry
And try to keep
Your little head upon my shoulder
Now go to sleep

Well the elms and the poplars
Were all turning their backs
Past the rumbling station
We followed the tracks
We found an untrodden path
And followed it down
The moon in the sky
Like a dislodged crown
And my hands they burned
In the folds of her coat
Breathing milky white air
From deep in her throat

Oh baby please don't cry
And try to keep
Your little head upon my shoulder
Now go to sleep

I told Sally in whispers
I'll never bring you harm
Her breast it was small
And warm in my palm
I told her the moon
Was a magical thing
It shone gold in the winter
And silver in spring
And we walked and walked
Across the endless sands
Just me and my Sally
Along the loom of the land

Oh baby please don't cry
And try to keep
Your little head upon my shoulder
Now try to sleep
Oh baby please don't cry
And don't you weep

1994,Let Love In,1,Do You Love Me ?,y,"I found her on a night of fire and noise
Wild bells rang in a wild sky
I knew from that moment on
I'd love her till the day that I died
And I kissed away a thousand tears
My lady of the Various Sorrows
Some begged, some borrowed, some stolen
Some kept safe for tomorrow
On an endless night, silver star spangled
The bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you

She was given to me to put things right
And I stacked all my accomplishments beside her
Yet I seemed so obsolete and small
I found God and all His devils inside her
In my bed she cast the blizzard out
A mock sun blazed upon her head
So completely filled with light she was
Her shadow fanged and hairy and mad
Our love-lines grew hopelessly tangled
And the bells from the chapel went jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
Like I love you

She had a heart full of love and devotion
She had a mindful of tyranny and terror
Well, I try, I do, I really try
But I just err, baby, I do, I error
So come and find me, my darling one
I'm down to the grounds, the very dregs
Ah, here she comes, blocking the sun
Blood running down the inside of her legs
The moon in the sky is battered and mangled
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle, jingle-jangle

(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?
(Do you love me?) Do you love me?

All things move toward their end
I knew before I met her that I would lose her
I swear I made every effort to be good to her
I made every effort not to abuse her
Crazy bracelets on her wrists and her ankles
And the bells from the chapel go jingle-jangle

Hey man, you know
You're never coming back
Past the square, past the bridge
Past the mills, past the stacks

1994,Let Love In,10,Do You Love Me ? (Part 2),y,"Onward! And Onward! And Onward I go
Where no man before could be bothered to go
Till the soles of my shoes are shot full of holes
And it's all downhill with a bullet
This ramblin' and rovin' has taken it's course
I'm grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses
And the city streets crack and a great hole forces
Me down with my soapbox, my pulpit
The theatre ceiling is silver star spangled
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

There's a man in the theatre with girlish eyes
Who's holding my childhood to ransom
On the screen there's a death
There's a rustle of cloth
And a sickly voice calling me handsome
There's a man in the theatre with sly girlish eyes
On the screen there's an ape, a gorilla
There's a groan, there's a cough, there's a rustle of cloth
And a voice that stinks of death and vanilla
This is a secret, mauled and mangled
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

The walls in the ceiling are painted in blood
The lights go down, the red curtains come apart
The room is full of smoke and dialogue I know by heart
And the coins in my pocket jingle-jangle
As the great screen crackled and popped
And the clock of my boyhood was wound down and stopped
And my handsome little body oddly propped
And my trousers right down to my ankles
Yes, onward! And upward!
And I'm off to find love
Do you love me? If you do, I'm thankful

Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?

This city is an ogre squatting by the river
It gives life but it takes it away, my youth
There comes a time when you just cannot deliver
This is a fact. This is a stone cold truth
Do you love me? I love you, handsome
But do you love me? Yes, I love you, you are handsome
Amongst the cogs and the wires, my youth
Vanilla breath and handsome apes with girlish eyes
Dreams that roam between truth and untruth
Memories that become monstrous lies
So onward! And Onward! And Onward I go!
Onward! And Upward! And I'm off to find love
With blue-black bracelets on my wrists and my ankles
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle

1996,Murder Ballads,1,Song Of Joy,y,"Have mercy on me, sir
Allow me to impose on you
I have no place to stay
And my bones are cold right through
I will tell you a story
Of a man and his family
And I swear that it is true
Ten years ago I met a girl named Joy
She was a sweet and happy thing
Her eyes were bright blue jewels
And we were married in the spring
I had no idea what happiness and little love could bring
Or what life had in store
But all things move toward their end
All things move toward their their end
All things move toward their their end
On that you can be sure
Hit it

Then one morning I awoke to find her weeping
And for many days to follow
She grew so sad and lonely
Became Joy in name only
Within her breast there launched an unnamed sorrow
And a dark and grim force set sail
Farewell happy fields
Where joy forever dwells
Hail horrors hail
Was it an act of contrition or some awful premonition?
As if she saw into the heart of her final blood-soaked night
Those lunatic eyes, that hungry kitchen knife
Ah, I see sir, that I have your attention!
Well, could it be?
How often I've asked that question
Well, then in quick succession
We had babies, one, two, three
We called them Hilda, Hattie and Holly
They were their mother's children
Their eyes were bright blue jewels
And they were quiet as a mouse
There was no laughter in the house
No, not from Hilda, Hattie or Holly
""No wonder"", people said, ""poor mother Joy's so melancholy""
Well, one night there came a visitor to our little home
I was visiting a sick friend
I was a doctor then
Joy and the girls were on their own, yeah
Oh yeah

Joy had been bound with electrical tape
In her mouth a gag
She'd been stabbed repeatedly
And stuffed into a sleeping bag
In their very cots my girls were robbed of their lives
Method of murder much the same as my wife's
Yep, method of murder much the same as my wife's
It was midnight when I arrived home
Said to the police on the telephone
Someone's taken four innocent lives
They never caught the man
He's still on the loose
It seems he has done many, many more
Quotes John Milton on the walls in the victim's blood
The police are investigating at tremendous cost
In my house he wrote ""his red right hand""
That, I'm told is from Paradise Lost
The wind round here gets wicked cold
But my story is nearly told
I fear the morning will bring quite a frost
So I've left my home
I drift from land to land
I am upon your step and you are a family man
Outside the vultures wheel
The wolves howl, the serpents hiss
And to extend this small favour, friend
Would be the sum of earthly bliss
Do you reckon me a friend?
The sun to me is dark
And silent as the moon
Do you, sir, have a room?
Are you beckoning me in?
Hit it!

Had a '28 Ford, had payments on that
Stagger Lee
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow
And told him, ""Never ever come back no more
Stagger Lee""
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the mud
Till he came to a place called The Bucket Of Blood
Stagger Lee
He said ""Mr Motherfucker, you know who I am""
The barkeeper said, ""No, and I don't give a good goddamn""
To Stagger Lee
He said, ""Well bartender, it's so plain to see
I'm the bad motherfucker called Stagger Lee
Mr. Stagger Lee""
Barkeep said, ""Yeah, I've heard your name down the way
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day
Mr Stagger Lee""
Well ah, those were the last words that the barkeep said
Cause Stag put four holes in his motherfucking head

Just then in came a broad called Nellie Brown
Known to make more money than any bitch in town
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt
Over to Stagger Lee, she startin' to flirt
Oh, Stagger Lee
She saw the barkeep, said, ""O God, he can't be dead!""
Stag said, ""Well, just count the holes in the motherfucker's head!""
She said, ""You ain't look like you scored in quite a time
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime
Mr. Stagger Lee!""
""But there's something I have to say before you begin
You'll have to be gone before my man Billy Dilly comes in
Mr. Stagger Lee""
""I'll stay here till Billy Dilly comes in, till time comes to pass
And furthermore I'll fuck Billy Dilly in his motherfucking ass""
Said Stagger Lee
""I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get to one fat boy's asshole!""
Said Stagger Lee
Just then Billy Dilly rolls in and he says, ""You must be
The mad motherfucker called Stagger Lee""
""I'm Stagger Lee
Yeah, I'm Stagger Lee and you better get down on your knees
And suck my dick, because If you don't you're gonna be dead""

She stared in my eyes and smiled
For her lips were the colour of the roses
That grew down the river, all bloody and wild

My trembling subsided in his sure embrace
He would be my first man, and with a careful hand
He wiped at the tears that ran down my face

As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist

1996,Murder Ballads,6,The Curse Of Millhaven,y,"I live in a town called Millhaven
And it's small and it's mean and it's cold
But if you come around just as the sun goes down
You can watch the whole thing turn to gold
It's around about then that I used to go a-roaming

Singing La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all gotta die

My name is Loretta, but I prefer Lottie
I'm closing in on my fifteenth year
If you think you have seen a pair of eyes more green
Then you sure haven't see them around here
Well my hair is a-yeller' and I'm always a-combing

La la la la La la la lie
My mama often told me that we all got to die

You must have heard about The Curse Of Millhaven
How last Christmas Bill Blakey's little boy didn't come home
They found him the next week up in One Mile Creek
With his head bashed in and his pockets full of stones
Well, just imagine all the wailing and the moaning

La la la la La la la lie
Even little Billy Blakey's boy, he had to die

Then Professor O'Rye from Millhaven High
Found nailed to his door his prize-winning terrier
The next day the old fool brought little Biko to school
And we all had to watch as he buried her
Well his eulogy to Biko had all the tears flowing

La la la la La la la lie
Even God's little creatures, they have to die

Our little town fell into a state of shock
A lot of people were saying things that made little sense
The next thing you know the head of Handyman Joe
Was found in the fountain of the Mayor's residence
Well foul play can really get a small town going

La la la la La la la lie
Even God's children, they have to die

In a cruel twist of fate, old Mrs Colgate
Was stabbed but the job was not complete
Well, the last thing she said before the cops pronounced her dead
Was, ""My killer is Loretta and she lives across the street!""
And twenty cops burst through my door without even phoning

La la la la La la la lie
The young ones and the old ones, they all gotta die

Yes, it is I, Lottie, The Curse Of Millhaven
I've struck horror in the heart of this town
Like my eyes ain't green and my hair ain't yeller'
It's more like the other way around
I got a pretty little mouth underneath all the foaming

La la la la La la la lie
Sooner or later, we all gotta die

Since I was no bigger than a weevil they've been saying I was evil
That if ""bad"" was a boot that I'd fit it
That I'm a wicked young lady, but I've been trying hard lately
Aw, fuck it, I'm a monster, I admit it!
Well it makes me so mad that my blood starts a-going

La la la la La la la lie
Mama always told me that we all gotta die

Well yeah, I drowned the Blakey kid, stabbed Mrs. Colgate, I admit
Did the handyman with his circular saw in his garden shed
But I never crucified little Biko, that was two junior high school psychos
Stinky Bohoon and his friend with the pumpkin-sized head
I'll sing to the lot, now that you got me going

La la la la La la la lie
All God's children have all gotta die

Then there' all the others, all our sisters and brothers
You assumed were accidents, best forgotten
Recall the children who broke through the ice on Lake Tahoo?
Everyone assumed the ""Warning"" signs had followed them to the bottom
Well, they're underneath the house where I do quite a bit of stowing

La la la la La la la lie
Even twenty little children, now they had to die

And the fire of '91 that razed the Bella Vista slum
That was the biggest shit-fight this country's ever seen
Insurance companies ruined, land lords getting sued
All cause of a wee little girl with a can of gasoline
Those flames really roared when the wind started blowing

La la la la La la la lie
Well a rich man and a poor man, they all gotta die

Well I confessed to all these crimes and they put me on trial
I was laughing when they took me away
Off to the asylum in an old black Mariah
Well it ain't home, but you know, it's better than jail
It ain't such a bad old place to have a home in

La la la la La la la lie
All God's children they all gotta die

Now I got shrinks that will not rest with their endless Rorschach tests
I keep telling them that I think they're out to get me
They ask me if I feel remorse and I answer, ""Why of course!
There's so much more I could have done if they'd let me!""
So it's Rorschach and Prozac, and everything is groovy

Well, I swooped magnificent upon her
As she sat shivering in her grief
Like the Madonna painted on the church-house wall
In whale's blood and banana leaf
Her throat crumbled in my hands
And I spun heroically around
To see Caffrey rising from his seat
I shot that mother fucker down
Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

""I have no free will"", I sang
As I flew about the murder
Mrs. Richard Holmes, she screamed
You really should have heard her
Well I sang and I laughed, I howled and I wept
I panted like a pup
I blew a hole in Mrs. Richard Holmes
And her husband stupidly stood up
As he screamed, ""You are an evil man""
And I paused a while to wonder
""If I have no free will then how can I
Be morally culpable, I wonder""
I shot Richard Holmes in the stomach
Gingerly he sat down
And he whispered weirdly, ""No offense""
And then lay upon the ground
""None taken"", I replied to him
To which he gave a little cough
And with blazing wings I neatly aimed
Blew his head completely off
I've lived in this town for thirty years
To no-one I am a stranger
And I put new bullets in my gun
Chamber upon chamber
And I turned my gun on the bird-like Mr. Brookes
I thought of Saint Francis and his sparrows
And as I shot down the youthful Richardson
It was Sebastian I thought of, and his arrows
Yeah, yeah, listen, listen

I said, ""I want to introduce myself
And I am glad that all you came""
And I leapt upon the bar
And then I shouted out my name
Well Jerry Bellows, he hugged his stool
Closed his eyes and shrugged and laughed
And with an ashtray as big as a fucking really big brick
I split his skull in half
His blood spilled across the bar
Like a steaming scarlet brook
And then I knelt at it's edge on the counter
Wiped my tears away and looked
Well, the light in there was blinding
Full of God and ghosts of truth
And I smiled at Henry Davenport
Who made no attempt to move
Well, from the position I was standing
The strangest thing I ever saw
The bullet entered through the top of his chest
And blew his bowels out on the floor
And I floated down the counter
Showing no remorse
I shot a hole in Kathleen Carpenter
Recently divorced
The remorse I felt, remorse I had
It clung to every thing
From the raven hair upon my head
To the feathers on my wings
Remorse squeezed my hand in it's fraudulent claw
With it's golden hairless chest
And I glided through the bodies
And killed the fat man Vincent West
Who sat quietly in his chair
A man become a child
And I raised the gun up to his head
Executioner-style
He made no attempt to resist
So fat and dull and lazy
""Did you know I lived in your street?"" I said
And he looked at me as though I were crazy
""Oh"", he said, ""I had no idea""
And he grew as quiet as a mouse
While the roar of the pistol when it went off
Near blew that hat right off the house
Hmm, uh uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, hmm

Well, I caught my eye in the mirror
Gave it a long and loving inspection
""There stands some kind of man"", I roared
And there did, in the reflection
My hair combed back like a raven's wing
My muscles hard and tight
And curling from the business end of my gun
Was a query-mark of cordite
Well I spun to the left, I spun to the right
I spun to the left again
""Fear me! Fear me! Fear me!""
But no one did cause they were dead
Huh, oh yeah, hmm, yeah

And then there were the police sirens wailing
And then a bull-horn squelched and blared
""Drop your weapons and come out
With your hands held in the air""
Well, I checked the chamber of my gun
Saw I had one final bullet left
My hand, it looked almost human
As I raised it bravely to my head
""Drop your weapon and come out!
Keep your hands above your head!""
I had one one long hard think about dying
And did exactly what they said
There must have been fifty cops out there
In a circle around O'Malley's bar
""Don't shoot"", I cried, ""I'm a man unarmed!""
So they put me in their car
And they sped me away from that terrible scene
And I glanced out of the window
Saw O'Malley's bar, saw the cops and the cars
And I started counting on my fingers
Ah, one, ah two, ah, three ah, four
O'Malley's bar
O'Malley's bar

O'Malley's bar",I am tall and I am thin Of an enviable height And I've been known to be quite handsome In a certain angle and in certain light Well I entered into O'Malley's Said O'Malley I have a thirst O'Malley merely smiled at me Said You wouldn't be the first I knocked on the bar and pointed To a bottle on the shelf And as O'Malley poured me out a drink I sniffed and crossed myself My hand decided that the time was nigh And for a moment it slipped from view And when it returned it fairly burned With confidence anew Well the thunder from my steely fist Made all the glasses jangle When I shot him I was so handsome It was the light it was the angle Huh hmm yeah yeah Neighbors I cried Friends I screamed I banged my fist upon the bar I bear no grudge against you And my dick felt long and hard I am the man for which no God waits But for which the whole world yearns And I'm marked by darkness and by blood And by a thousand powder-burns Well you know those fish with the swollen lips That clean the ocean floor When I looked at poor old O'Malley's wife Well that's exactly what I saw Well I jammed the barrel under her chin And her face looked raw and vicious Her head it landed in the sink With all the dirty dishes And her little daughter Siobhan Pulled beers from dusk till down Amongst the townfolk she was a bit of a joke But she pulled the best beer in town Well I swooped

I think that’s well understood
You can see it everywhere you look

Under blossom we made our vows

Awoken by the morning bird

A different tree now lines the streets
Shaking its fists in the air

The windows rattling in the gales

Made out of her wedding veils

1997,The Boatman's Call,7,Where Do We Go Now But Nowhere?,,"I remember a girl so very well
The carnival drums all mad in the air
Grim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell
O where do we go now but nowhere
In a colonial hotel we fucked up the sun
And then we fucked it down again
Well the sun comes up and the sun goes down
Going round and round to nowhere
The kitten that padded and purred on my lap
Now swipes at my face with the paw of a bear
I turn the other cheek and you lay into that
O where do we go now but nowhere

O wake up, my love, my lover wake up
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up

Across clinical benches with nothing to talk
Breathing tea and biscuits and the Serenity Prayer
While the bones of our child crumble like chalk
O where do we go now but nowhere

Loose-limbed and laughing and brazen and bare
Sits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light
O where do we go now but nowhere

Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair
Full of glass and bleach and my old razorblades
O where do we go now but nowhere

O wake up, my love, my lover wake up
O wake up, my love, my lover wake up

If they'd give me my clothes back then I could go home
From this fresh, this clean, antiseptic air
Behind the locked gates an old donkey moans
O where do we go now but nowhere
Around the duck pond we grimly mope
Gloomily and mournfully we go rounds again
And one more doomed time and without much hope
Going round and around to nowhere
From the balcony we watched the carnival band
The crack of the drum a little child did scare
I can still feel his fingers pressed in my hand

1997,The Boatman's Call,9,Black Hair,,"Last night my kisses were banked in black hair
And in my bed my lover her hair was midnight black
And all her mystery dwelled within her black hair
And her black hair framed a happy heart shaped face
And heavy hooded eyes inside her black hair
Shined at me from the depths of her hair of deepest black
While my fingers pushed into her straight black hair
Pulling her black hair back from her happy heart-shaped face
To kiss her milk-white throat, a dark curtain of black hair
Smothered me, my lover with her beautiful black hair
The smell of it is heavy. It is charged with life
On my fingers the smell of her deep black hair
Full of all my whispered words, her black hair
And wet with tears and good-byes, her hair of deepest black
All my tears cried against her milk-white throat
Hidden behind the curtain of her beautiful black hair
As deep as ink and black, black as the deepest sea
The smell of her black hair upon my pillow
Where her head and all its black hair did rest

1997,The Boatman's Call,10,Idiot Prayer,,"They're taking me down, my friend

Where only those in pain go?
Well it takes two to tango
We will meet again, my love
I know

If you're in Heaven then you'll forgive me, dear
Because that's what they do up there
If you're in Hell, then what can I say
You probably deserved it anyway
I guess I'm gonna find out any day
For we'll meet again
And there'll be Hell to pay

Your face comes to me from the depths, dear
Your silent mouth mouths, 'Yes"", dear
Dark red and big with blood
They're gonna shut me down, my love
They're gonna launch me into the stars
Well, all things come to pass

In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over

You who are so far from me
Far from me
So far from me
Way across some cold neurotic sea
Far from me

I would talk to you of all matter of things
With a smile you would reply
Then the sun would leave your pretty face
And you'd retreat from the front of your eyes
I keep hearing that you're doing best
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast

You are so far from me
Far from me
Far from me

There is no knowledge but I know it
There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice
That sails to me across the line
From the ridiculous to the sublime
It's good to hear you're doing so well
But really can't you find somebody else that you can ring and tell

Did you ever
Care for me?
Were you ever
There for me?
So far from me

You told me you'd stick by me
Through the thick and through the thin
Those were your very words
My fair-weather friend
You were my brave-hearted lover
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother

2001,No More Shall We Part,1,As I Sat Sadly By Her Side,,"As I sat sadly by her side
At the window, through the glass
She stroked a kitten in her lap
And we watched the world as it fell past
Softly she spoke these words to me
And with brand new eyes, open wide
We pressed our faces to the glass
As I sat sadly by her side

She said, ""Father, mother, sister, brother
Uncle, aunt, nephew, niece
Soldier, sailor, physician, labourer
Actor, scientist, mechanic, priest
Earth and moon and sun and stars
Planets and comets with tails blazing
All are there forever falling
Falling lovely and amazing""

Then she smiled and turned to me
And waited for me to reply
Her hair was falling down her shoulders
As I sat sadly by her side

As I sat sadly by her side
The kitten she did gently pass
Over to me and again we pressed
Our indifferent faces to the glass
""That may be very well"", I said
""But watch the one falling in the street
See him gesture to his neighbors
And see him trampled beneath their feet
All outward motion connects to nothing
For each is concerned with their immediate need
Witness the man reaching up from the gutter
See the other one stumbling on who can not see""

With trembling hand I turned toward her
And pushed the hair out of her eyes
The kitten jumped back to her lap
As I sat sadly by her side

Then she drew the curtains down
And said, ""Oh, when will you ever learn
That what happens there beyond the glass
Is simply none of your concern?
God has given you but one heart
You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers

And God don't care for your benevolence
Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others
Nor does he care for you to sit
At windows in judgement of the world He created
While sorrows pile up around you
Ugly, useless and over-inflated""

At which she turned her head away
Great tears leaping from her eyes
I could not wipe the smile from my face

2001,No More Shall We Part,3,Hallelujah,,"On the first day of May I took to the road
I'd been staring out the window most of the morning
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning
As a warning
As a warning
As a warning
I'd given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were ill prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared
All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud
Like a shroud
Like a shroud
Like a shroud
There rose before me a little house
With all hope and dreams kept within
A woman's voice close to my ear
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?""
""You looked soaked to the skin""
Soaked to the skin
Soaked to the skin
Soaked to the skin

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I turned to the woman and the woman was young
I extended a hearty salutation
But I knew if my nurse had been here
She would never in a thousand years
Permit me to accept that invitation
Invitation
That invitation
That invitation
Now, you might think it wise to risk it all
Throw caution to the reckless wind
But with her hot cocoa and her medication
My nurse had been my one salvation
So I turned back home
I turned back home I turned back home
Singing my song

Hallelujah
The tears are welling in my eyes again
Hallelujah
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in
Hallelujah
And twenty pretty girls to carry
Them down
Hallelujah
And twenty deep holes to bury them in

2001,No More Shall We Part,7,Oh My Lord,,"I thought I'd take a walk today
It's a mistake I sometimes make
My kids lay asleep in bed
My wife lay wide-awake
I kissed her softly on the brow
I tried not to make a sound
But with stony eyes she looked at me
And gently squeezed my hand
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision
Call it intuition, something learned from mother
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her

Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms around me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord

They called at me through the fence
They were not making any sense
They claimed that I had lost the plot
Kept saying that I was not
The man I used to be
They held their babes aloft
Threw marsh mellows at the Security
And said that I'd grown soft
Call it intuition, call it a creeping suspicion
But their words of derision meant they hardly knew me
For even I could see in the way they looked at me
The Spear of Destiny sticking right through me

Oh Lord Oh my lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh lord
Oh My Lord

Now I'm at the hairdressers
People watch me as they move past
A guy wearing plastic antlers
Presses his bum against the glass
Now I'm down on my hands and knees
And it's so fucking hot!
Someone cries, ""What are you looking for?""
I scream, ""The plot, the plot!""
I grab my telephone, I call my wife at home
She screams, ""Leave us alone!"" I say, ""Hey, it's only me""
The hairdresser with his scissors, he holds up the mirror
I look back and shiver; I can't even believe what I can see

Be mindful of the prayers you send
Pray hard but pray with care
For the tears that you are crying now
Are just your answered prayers
The ladders of life that we scale merrily
Move mysteriously around
So that when you think you're climbing up, man
In fact you're climbing down
Into the hollows of glamour, where with spikes and hammer
With telescopic camera, they chose to turn the screw
Oh I hate them, Ma! Oh I hate them, Pa!
Oh I hate them all for what they went and done to you

Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms round me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord",I thought I'd take a walk today It's a mistake I sometimes make My kids lay asleep in bed My wife lay wide-awake I kissed her softly on the brow I tried not to make a sound But with stony eyes she looked at me And gently squeezed my hand Call it a premonition call it a crazy vision Call it intuition something learned from mother But when she looked up at me I could clearly see The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her Oh Lord Oh my Lord Oh Lord How have I offended thee Wrap your tender arms around me Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh My Lord They called at me through the fence They were not making any sense They claimed that I had lost the plot Kept saying that I was not The man I used to be They held their babes aloft Threw marsh mellows at the Security And said that I'd grown soft Call it intuition call it a creeping suspicion But their words of derision meant they hardly knew me For even I could see in the way they looked at me The Spear of Destiny sticking right through me Oh Lord Oh my lord Oh Lord How have I offended thee Wrap your tender arms round me Oh Lord Oh lord Oh My Lord Now I'm at the hairdressers People watch me as they move past A guy wearing plastic antlers Presses his bum against the glass Now I'm down on my hands and knees And it's so fucking hot Someone cries What are you looking for I scream The plot the plot I grab my telephone I call my wife at home She screams Leave us alone I say Hey it's only me The hairdresser with his scissors he holds up the mirror I look back and shiver I can't even believe what I can see Be mindful of the prayers you send Pray hard but pray with care For the tears that you are crying now Are just your answered prayers The ladders of life that we scale merrily Move mysteriously around So that when you think you're climbing up man In fact you're climbing down Into the hollows of glamour where with spikes and hammer With telescopic camera they chose to turn the screw Oh I hate them Ma Oh I hate them Pa Oh I hate them all for what they went and done to you Oh Lord Oh my Lord Oh Lord How have I offended thee Wrap your tender arms round me Oh Lord Oh Lord Oh My Lord,227

The Angel
Down Athenaeum Lane to the cathedral
Through the churchyard, I wandered
Sat for a spell there and I pondered
My back to the gates of the garden
My back to the gates of the garden
My back to the gates of the garden

Fugitive fathers, sickly infants, decent mothers
Runaways and suicidal lovers
Assorted boxes of ordinary bones
Of aborted plans and sudden shattered hopes
In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden
In unhappy rows, up to the gates of the garden
In unlucky rows, up to the gates of the garden

Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
Won't you meet me at the gates
To the garden

Beneath the creeping shadow of the tower
The bell from St. Edmunds informs me of the hour
I turn to find you waiting there for me
In sunlight and I see the way that you breathe
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden
Alive and leaning on the gates of the garden

Leave these ancient places to the angels
Let the saints attend to their keeping of the cathedrals
And leave the dead beneath the ground so cold
For God is in this hand that I hold
As we open up the gates of the garden

2001,No More Shall We Part,12,Darker With The Day,,"So with that, I thought I'd take a final walk
The tide of public opinion had started to abate
The neighbors, bless them, had turned out to be all talk
I could see their frightened faces peering at me through the gate
I was looking for an end to this, for some kind of closure
Time moved so rapidly, I had no hope of keeping track of it
And I thought of my friends who had died of exposure
And I remembered other ones who had died from the lack of it

And in my best shoes, I started falling forward down the street
Stopped at a church and jostled through the crowd
Love followed just behind me, panting at my feet
As the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud
Inside I sat, seeking the presence of a God
Searched through the pictures in a leather-bound book
And I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a fisherman's hook

And babe, it seems so long
Since you've been gone away
And I just got to say
That it grows darker with the day

Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun
It was a good day and an evil day and all was bright and new
Seemed to me that most destruction was being done
By those who could not choose between the two
Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboys, clones
The streets groan with the little Caesars, Napoleons, and cunts
With their building blocks and their tiny plastic phones
Counting on their fingers, with their crumbs down their fronts

I passed by your garden, saw you with your flowers
The Camellias, Magnolias, and Azaleas so sweet
You stood there invisible in the panicking crowds
You looked so beautiful in the rising heat
I smell smoke, see little fires bursting on the lawns
People carry on regardless, listening to their hands
Great cracks appear in the pavement, the earth yawns
Bored and disgusted, to do us down

And babe, it seems so long
Since you've been gone
You went away
And I just got to say
That it grows darker with the day

All these streets are frozen now. I come and go
Full of a longing for something I do not know
My father sits slumped in the deepening snow
As I search, in and out, above, about, and below

Babe, it seems so long
Since you've been gone
And you went away
And I hope and I pray
That it grows darker with the day",So with that I thought I'd take a final walk The tide of public opinion had started to abate The neighbors bless them had turned out to be all talk I could see their frightened faces peering at me through the gate I was looking for an end to this for some kind of closure Time moved so rapidly I had no hope of keeping track of it And I thought of my friends who had died of exposure And I remembered other ones who had died from the lack of it And in my best shoes I started falling forward down the street Stopped at a church and jostled through the crowd Love followed just behind me panting at my feet As the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud Inside I sat seeking the presence of a God Searched through the pictures in a leather-bound book And I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood And a gilled Jesus shivering on a fisherman's hook And babe it seems so long Since you've been gone away And I just got to say That it grows darker with the day Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun It was a good day and an evil day and all was bright and new Seemed to me that most destruction was being done By those who could not choose between the two Amateurs dilettantes hacks cowboys clones The streets groan with the little Caesars Napoleons and cunts With their building blocks and their tiny plastic phones Counting on their fingers with their crumbs down their fronts I passed by your garden saw you with your flowers The Camellias Magnolias and Azaleas so sweet You stood there invisible in the panicking crowds You looked so beautiful in the rising heat I smell smoke see little fires bursting on the lawns People carry on regardless listening to their hands Great cracks appear in the pavement the earth yawns Bored and disgusted to do us down And babe it seems so long Since you've been gone You went away And I just got to say That it grows darker with the day All these streets are frozen now I come and go Full of a longing for something I do not know My father sits slumped in the deepening snow As I search in and out above about and below Babe it seems so long Since you've been gone And you went away And I hope and I pray That it grows darker with the day,233

No, I said, I have none to spare

You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
I ain't no lover-boy

For apple, plum and brand new pear

She slapped the snow from off her glove
And moved on without a sound

You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
I ain't no lover-boy",She passed by my window Her eyes were all aglow And bent to pick her glove she'd dropped From the bright and brittle snow Nature had spoken it in the Spring With apple plum and brand new pear Have you time for my company No I said I have none to spare You gotta sanctify my love You gotta sanctify my love You gotta sanctify my love I ain't no lover-boy For apple plum and brand new pear Soon wither on the ground She slapped the snow from off her glove And moved on without a sound You gotta sanctify my love You gotta sanctify my love You gotta sanctify my love I ain't no lover-boy,66

2004,Abattoir Blues / The Lyre Of Orpheus,3,Hiding All Away,,"You went looking for me dear?
Down by the sea
You found some little silver fish
But you didn't find me
I was hiding, dear, hiding all way
I was hiding, dear, hiding all way

You went to the museum
You climbed a spiral stair
You searched for me all among
The knowledgeable air
I was hidden, babe, hiding all away
I was hidden, dear, hiding all away

You entered the cathedral
When you heard the solemn knell
I was not sitting with the gargoyles
I was not swinging from the bells
I was hiding, dear, I was hiding all away
I was hiding, dear, I was hiding all away

You asked an electrician
If he'd seen me round his place
He touched you with his fingers
Sent sparks zapping out your face
I was hidden, dear, hiding all away
I was not there, dear, hiding all away

You went and asked your doctor
To get some advice
He shot you full of Pethadine
And then he billed you twice
But I was hiding, dear, hiding all away
But I was hiding, dear, hiding all away

You approached a high court judge
You thought he'd be on the level
He wrapped a rag around your face
And beat you with his gavel
I was hiding, babe, hiding all away
I was hidden, dear, hiding all away

You asked at the local constabulary
They said, he's up to his same old tricks
They leered at you with their baby blues
And rubbed jelly on their sticks
I had to get out of there, babe, hiding all away
I had to get out of there, dear, hiding all away

You searched through all my poets
From Sappho through to Auden
I saw the book fall from your hands
As you slowly died of boredom
I had been there, dear
But I was not there anymore
I had been there, now I'm hiding all way

You walked into the ball of fame
And approached my imitators
Some were stuffing their faces with caviar
Some were eating cold potatoes
I was hiding, dear, hiding all away
I was hiding, dear, hiding all away

You asked a famous cook if he'd seen me
He opened his oven wide
He basted you with butter, babe
And made you crawl inside
I was not in there, dear, hiding all away
I was not in there, dear, hiding all away

You asked the butcher
Who lifted up his cleaver
Stuck his fist up your dress
Said he must've been mad to leave you
But I had to get away, dear, hiding all away
I had to get away, dear, I was hidden all away

Some of us we hide away
Some of us we don't
Some will live to love another day
And some of us won't
But we all know there is a law
And that law, it is love
And we all know there's a war coming
Coming from above
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming

I saved you the best seat in the house
Right up in the front row
The stars have been torn down

As the trees bend down their branches
And touch you with their fingertips

We could navigate our position by the stars
But they've taken out the stars

Condition by the moon

I will throw a blanket over

Against the laughter in the other

While the planets try to get organized
Way above the stratosphere

The cornflower and the chicory

John Wilmot penned his poetry
Riddled with the pox
Nabokov wrote on index cards
At a lectern, in his socks
St. John of the Cross did his best stuff
Imprisoned in a box
And Johnny Thunders was half alive
When he wrote Chinese Rocks
Well, me, I'm lying here, with nothing in my ears
Me, I'm lying here, with nothing in my ears
Me, I'm lying here, for what seems years
I'm just lying on my bed with nothing in my head

While writing Das Kapital
And Gauguin, he buggered off, man
And went all tropical
While Philip Larkin stuck it out
In a library in Hull
And Dylan Thomas died drunk in
St. Vincent's hospital
I will kneel at your feet
I will lie at your door
I will rock you to sleep
I will roll on the floor

Nothing in this life
I'll ask for nothing

Brother, and blow it
If you've got a field, that don't yield
Well get up and hoe it
I look at you and you look at me and
Deep in our hearts know it
That you weren't much of a muse
But then I weren't much of a poet
I will be your slave, I will peel you grapes
Up on your pedestal with your ivory and apes
With your book of ideas with your alchemy

2004,Abattoir Blues / The Lyre Of Orpheus,6,Nature Boy,,"I was just a boy when I sat down
To watch the news on TV
I saw some ordinary slaughter
I saw some routine atrocity
My father said, don't look away
You got to be strong, you got to be bold, now
He said, that in the end it is beauty
That is going to save the world, now

And she moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
She moves something deep inside of me

I was walking around the flower show like a leper
Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria
When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair
Up against the pink and purple wisteria
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me
With some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts
That were not in my best interests to mention

And she moves among the flowers
And she floats upon the smoke
She moves among the shadows
She moves me with just one little look

You took me back to your place
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit
You played the patriot, you raised the flag
And I stood at full salute
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb
And made it impossible to speak
As you closed in, in slow motion
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek

She moves among the shadows
She floats upon the breeze
She moves among the candles
And we moved through the days
And through the years

Years passed by, we were walking by the sea
Half delirious
You smiled at me and said, Babe
I think this thing is getting kind of serious
You pointed at something and said
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
It was then that I broke down
It was then that you lifted me up again

O Mama O Mama

Orpheus looked at his instrument
And he gave the wire a pluck
He heard a sound so beautiful
He gasped and said O my God
O Mama O Mama

He rushed inside to tell his wife
He went racing down the halls
Eurydice was still asleep in bed
Like a sack of cannonballs
O Mama O Mama

Look what I've made, cried Orpheus
And he plucked a gentle note
Eurydice's eyes popped from their sockets
And her tongue burst through her throat
O Mama O Mama

O God, what have I done, he said
As her blood pooled in the sheets
But in his heart he felt a bliss
With which nothing could compete
O Mama O Mama

Orpheus went leaping through the fields
Strumming as hard as he did please
Birdies detonated in the sky
Bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees
O Mama O Mama

Orpheus strummed till his fingers bled
He hit a G minor 7
He woke up God from a deep, deep sleep
God was a major player in heaven
O Mama O Mama

God picked up a giant hammer
And He threw it with an thunderous yell
It smashed down hard on Orpheus' head
And knocked him down a well
O Mama O Mama

The well went down very deep
Very deep went down the well
The well went down so very deep
Well, the well went down to hell
O Mama O Mama

Poor Orpheus woke up with a start
All amongst the rotting dead
His lyre tacked safe under his arm
His brains all down his head
O Mama O Mama

Eurydice appeared brindled in blood
And she said to Orpheus
If you play that fucking thing down here
I'll stick it up your orifice!
O Mama O Mama

This lyre lark is for the birds, said Orpheus
It's enough to send you bats
Let's stay down here, Eurydice, dear
And we'll have a bunch of screaming brats
O Mama O Mama

Orpheus picked up his lyre for the last time
He was on a real low down bummer
And stared deep into the abyss and said
This one is for Mama
O Mama O Mama
O Mama O Mama
O Mama O Mama
O Mama O Mama
O Mama O Mama
O Mama O Mama",Orpheus sat gloomy in his garden shed Wondering what to do With a lump of wood a piece of wire And a little pot of glue O Mama O Mama He sawed at the wood with half a heart And glued it top to bottom He strung a wire in between He was feeling something rotten O Mama O Mama Orpheus looked at his instrument And he gave the wire a pluck He heard a sound so beautiful He gasped and said O my God O Mama O Mama He rushed inside to tell his wife He went racing down the halls Eurydice was still asleep in bed Like a sack of cannonballs O Mama O Mama Look what I've made cried Orpheus And he plucked a gentle note Eurydice's eyes popped from their sockets And her tongue burst through her throat O Mama O Mama O God what have I done he said As her blood pooled in the sheets But in his heart he felt a bliss With which nothing could compete O Mama O Mama Orpheus went leaping through the fields Strumming as hard as he did please Birdies detonated in the sky Bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees O Mama O Mama Orpheus strummed till his fingers bled He hit a G minor 7 He woke up God from a deep deep sleep God was a major player in heaven O Mama O Mama God picked up a giant hammer And He threw it with an thunderous yell It smashed down hard on Orpheus' head And knocked him down a well O Mama O Mama The well went down very deep Very deep went down the well The well went down so very deep Well the well went down to hell O Mama O Mama Poor Orpheus woke up with a start All amongst the rotting dead His lyre tacked safe under his arm His brains all down his head O Mama O Mama Eurydice appeared brindled in blood And she said to Orpheus If you play that fucking thing down here I'll stick it up your orifice O Mama O Mama This lyre lark is for the birds said Orpheus It's enough to send you bats Let's stay down here Eurydice dear And we'll have a bunch of screaming brats O Mama O Mama Orpheus picked up his lyre for the last time He was on a real low down bummer And stared deep into the abyss and said This one is for Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama O Mama,204

I said to the man who'd been sleeping rough
To sit within a fragrant breeze

And held my soft white hand

His hands they headed south
And my cheek it burned

Dig yourself, Lazarus
Dig yourself, Lazarus
Dig yourself, back in that hole

Larry made his nest up in the autumn branches
Built from nothing but high hopes and thin air
Collected up some baby blasted mothers
They took their chances and for a while
They lived quite happily up there
He came from New York City man
But he couldn't take the pace
He thought it was like a dog eat dog world
But he went to San Francisco
Spent a year in outer space
With a sweet little San Franciscan girl
I can hear my mother wailing
And a whole lot of scraping of chairs

I don't know what it is
But there's definitely something going on upstairs
Dig yourself, Lazarus
Dig yourself, Lazarus
Dig yourself, Lazarus
Dig yourself, back in that hole

Yeah, New York City, he had to get out of there
And San Francisco, well, I don't know
And then to LA, where he spent about a day
He thought even the pale sky-stars were smart
Enough to keep well away from LA
Meanwhile Larry made up names for the ladies
Like Ms Boo and Ms Quick
He stockpiled weapons and took pot shots in the air
He feasted on their lovely bodies like a lunatic
And wrapped himself up in their soft yellow hair
I can hear chants and incantations
And some guy is mentioning me in his prayers

Well New York City Man
San Francisco, LA, I don't know
But Larry grew increasingly neurotic and obscene
I mean: he, he never asked to be raised up from the tomb
I mean no one ever actually asked him to forsake his dreams
Anyway, to cut a long story short
Fame finally found him
Mirrors became his torturers
Cameras snapped him at every chance
The women all went back to their homes
And their husbands
Secret smiles in the corners of their mouths
He ended up, like so many of them do
Back in the streets of New York City
In a soup queue
A dope fiend
A slave
Then prison
Then the mad house
Then the grave
Oh poor Larry
But what do we really know of the dead
And who actually cares?

And what we have now will never be that way again
So we call upon the author to explain
Our myxomatoid kids spraddle the streets
We've shunned them from the greasy grind
The poor little things they look so sad and old
As they mount us from behind
I ask them to desist and to refrain!
And then we call upon the author to explain
Well, rosary clutched in his hand
He died with tubes up his nose
And a cabal of angels with finger cymbals
Chanted his name in code
We shook our fists at the punishing rain
And we called upon the author to explain
He said, everything is messed up round here
Everything is banal and jejune
There's a planetary conspiracy against the likes of you and me
In this idiot constituency of the moon
Well, he knew exactly who to blame!
And we call upon the author to explain
Prolix! Prolix!
Nothing a pair of scissors can't fix
Well, I go guruing down the street
And young people gather 'round my feet
And they ask me things, but I don't know where to start
They ignite the powder trail straight to my father's heart
And, yeah, once again
I call upon the author to explain
Yeah, we call upon the author to explain
Who is this great burdensome slavering dog-thing
That mediocres my every thought?
I feel like a vacuum cleaner—a complete sucker!
It's fucked up and he is a fucker
But what an enormous and encyclopedic brain!
I call upon the author to explain
Rampant discrimination
Mass poverty, third world debt
Infectious disease, global inequality
And deepening socio-economic divisions
Well, it does in your brain
We call upon the author to explain
Now hang on
My friend Doug is tapping on the window!
Hey Doug, how you been? (hey Doug)
Well, he brings me a book on holocaust poetry – complete with pictures
And then he tells me to get ready for the rain
And we call upon the author to explain
Prolix! Prolix!
Nothing a pair of scissors can't fix
Bukowski was a jerk!
Berryman was best!
He wrote like wet papier-maché
But he went the Hemingway
Weirdly on wings and with maximum pain
We call upon the author to explain
Down in my bolt hole I see they've published
Another volume of unreconstructed rubbish
""The waves, the waves were soldiers moving""
Well, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you and again

2008,"Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!",7,Hold On To Yourself,,"I'm so far away from you
I'm pacing up and down my room
Does Jesus only love a man who loses?
I turn on the radio
There's some cat on the saxophone
Laying down a litany of excuses
There's madhouse longing in my baby's eyes
She rubs a lamp between her thighs
And hopes the genie comes out singing
And she lives in some forgotten song
And moves like she is zombie-strong
Breathes steady as the pendulum keeps swinging
You better hold on to yourself
Well, cities rust and fall to ruin
Factories close and cars go cruising
In and around the borders of her vision
She says oh woah woah woah
As Jesus makes the flowers grow
All around the scene of her collision
Oh you know, yes, I would
I would hold on to yourself
In the middle of the night
I try my best to chase outside
The phantoms and the ghosts and the fairy-girls
On 1001 nights like this
She mutters open sesame and Ali Baba and his forty thieves
Launch her off the face of the world
Well, you know
Oh baby, I'll come back
And I'll hold on to yourself
Babe, I'm 1000 miles away
And I just don't know what to say
Cause Jesus only loves a man who bruises
But darling we can clearly see
It's all life and fire and lunacy
And excuses and excuses and excuses

2008,"Dig, Lazarus, Dig!!!",9,Jesus Of The Moon,,"Stepped out of the St. James hotel
And I left you behind curled up like a child
A change is gonna come
And as the door whispered shut
I walked on down the high-windowed hall
You lay sleeping on the unmade bed
The weatherman on the television in the St. James hotel
Said
That the rains are gonna come
And I stepped out on the streets
All sparkling clean with the early morning dew
Maybe it was you or maybe it was me?
You came on like a punch in the heart
Lying there with the light on your hair
Like a Jesus of the moon
A Jesus of the planets and the stars
Well, I kept thinking about what the weatherman said
And if the voices of the living can be heard by the dead
Well, the day is gonna come when we find out
And in some kind of way I take a little comfort from that
Now and then
Cause people often talk about being scared of change
But for me I'm more afraid of things staying the same
Cause the game is never won
By standing in any one place
For too long
Maybe it was you or maybe it was me?
But there was a chord in you that I could not find to strike
You lying there with all the light in your hair
Like a Jesus of the moon
A Jesus of the planets and the stars
I see the many girls walking down the empty streets
Maybe once or twice one of them smiles at me
You can't blame anyone for saying hello
I say hey
I say hello, I say hello
Will it be me or will it be you?

Full of bedroom feathers
Janet is known to make dead men groan
In any kind of weather
I crawl over to her
I say hey baby
I say hey Janet
You are the one, you are the sun
And I'm your dutiful planet
But she ain't down with any of that
Cause she's heard that shit before
And I say uh huh, oh yeah you're right
Cause I see Betty X standing by the door
With more news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere
And it's getting strange in here
Yeah it's getting stranger every year

Alright now
Now Betty X is like Betty Y minus that fatal chromosome
Her hair is like the wine dark sea in which sailors come home
I say hey baby I say hey Betty X
I lean close up to her throat
This light you are carrying is like a lamp
Hanging from a distant boat
It is my light says Betty X
Betty X says this light ain't yours

I go down a corridor

He must be about one hundred foot tall
And he only has one eye
He asks me for my autograph
I write nobody and then
I wrap myself up in my woolly coat
And I blind him with my pen
Cause someone must have stuck something in my drink
Everything's getting strange lookin'

The other half are cooking

I cried, ""Strap me to the mast""

She danced across the room
We charted the progress of the planets
Around that boogie woogie moon
I called her my nubian princess
Gave her some sweet back fatass jive
Spent the next seven years between her legs
A-pining for my wife
But then by and by it all went wrong
I fell washed up on a shore
She stared down at me from up in the storm
And I sopped up on the floor

Don't it make you wanna get right on home
More news from nowhere
More news from nowhere, let me hear it now
Well here comes Elena with two black eyes
She's given herself a transfusion
She's filled herself with panda blood
To avoid all the confusion
I say the sun rises and falls with you
And various things about love
But a rising violence in me cuts all my circuits off
Well Elena she starts screaming
Her cheeks are full of psychotropic leaves
Her extinction was nearly absolute
When she turned her back on me

Who cares what the future brings?

And came upon a crossroad
The night was hot and black
I see Robert Johnson with a 10-dollar guitar
Strapped to his back looking for a tune
Ah, well here comes Lucifer with his canon law
And a hundred black babies running from his genocidal jaw
He got the real killer groove
Robert Johnson and the devil, man
Don't know who is gonna rip off who

Driving my car, flame trees on fire
Sitting and singing the Higgs Boson Blues
I'm tired, I'm looking for a spot to drop
All the clocks have stopped
In Memphis now in the Lorraine Motel
It's hot, it's hot - that's why they call it the Hot Spot
I'll take a room with a view
Hear a man preaching in a language that's completely new, yeah
And making the hot cocks in the flophouse bleed
While the cleaning ladies sob into their mops
And a bellhop hops and bops
A shot rings out to a spiritual groove
Everybody bleeding to that Higgs Boson Blues

And if I die tonight
Bury me in my favorite yellow patent leather shoes
With a mummified cat and a cone-like hat
That the caliphate forced on the Jews
Ah, can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat?

Like a black fly on the ceiling
Skinny, white haunches high and skyward
And a black oily gash crawling backwards across the carpet to smash all over everything
Wet, black fur against the sun going down
Over the shops and the cars and the crowds in the town

And this is the moment, this is exactly where she is born to be
Now this is what she does and this is what she is
And this is the moment, this is exactly where she is born to be

Two round holes where the air buckles and rushes in
Her body, moon blue, was a jellyfish
And I'm breathing deep and I'm there and I'm also not there
And spurting ink over the sheets but she remains, completely unexplained
Or maybe I'm just too tongue-tied to drink it up and swallow back the pain
I thought slavery had been abolished
How come it's gone and reared its ugly head again?

Stepping over heaps of sleeping children
Disappearing and further up and spinning out again
Up and further up she goes, up and out of the bed

2019,Ghosteen,9,Ghosteen,,"This world is beautiful
Held within its stars
I keep it in my heart
The stars are your eyes
I loved them right from the start
A world so beautiful
And I keep it in my heart

A ghosteen dances in my hand
Slowly twirling, twirling all around
A glowing circle in my hand
Dancing, dancing, dancing all around
A ghosteen dances in my hand (In my hand)
Slowly twirling, twirling all around (All around)
A ghosteen dances in my hand (In my hand)
Dancing, dancing, dancing all around (All around)
Here we go

There goes the moonlit man
Got a suitcase in his hand
He's moving on
Down the road
Things tend to fall apart starting with his heart
He kisses you lightly and he leaves
Leaves your sleeping body
Curled and dreaming around your smile, your smile

The three bears watch the TV
They age a lifetime, O' Lord
Mama bear holds the remote
Papa bear, he just floats
And baby bear, he has gone
To the moon in a boat, on a boat
I'm speaking about love now
And how the lights of love go down
You're in the back room washing his clothes
Love's like that, you know, it's like a tidal flow
And the past with its fierce undertow won't ever let us go
Won't ever let you go

If I could move the night I would
And I would turn the world around if I could
There's nothing wrong with loving something
You can't hold in your hand
You're sitting on the edge of your bed
Smoking and shaking your head
Well there's nothing wrong with loving things
That cannot even stand

Well there goes your moony man
With his suitcase in his hand
Well every road is lined with animals
That rise from their blood and walk
Well the moon won't get a wink of sleep
If I stay all night and talk
If I stay all night and talk",This world is beautiful Held within its stars I keep it in my heart The stars are your eyes I loved them right from the start A world so beautiful And I keep it in my heart A ghosteen dances in my hand Slowly twirling twirling all around A glowing circle in my hand Dancing dancing dancing all around A ghosteen dances in my hand In my hand Slowly twirling twirling all around All around A ghosteen dances in my hand In my hand Dancing dancing dancing all around All around Here we go There goes the moonlit man Got a suitcase in his hand He's moving on Down the road Things tend to fall apart starting with his heart He kisses you lightly and he leaves Leaves your sleeping body Curled and dreaming around your smile your smile The three bears watch the TV They age a lifetime O' Lord Mama bear holds the remote Papa bear he just floats And baby bear he has gone To the moon in a boat on a boat I'm speaking about love now And how the lights of love go down You're in the back room washing his clothes Love's like that you know it's like a tidal flow And the past with its fierce undertow won't ever let us go Won't ever let you go If I could move the night I would And I would turn the world around if I could There's nothing wrong with loving something You can't hold in your hand You're sitting on the edge of your bed Smoking and shaking your head Well there's nothing wrong with loving things That cannot even stand Well there goes your moony man With his suitcase in his hand Well every road is lined with animals That rise from their blood and walk Well the moon won't get a wink of sleep If I stay all night and talk If I stay all night and talk,170
2019,Ghosteen,10,Fireflies,,"Jesus lying in his mother’s arms
Is a photon released from a dying star
We move through the forest at night
The sky is full of momentary light
And everything we need is just too far
We are photons released from a dying star
We are fireflies a child has trapped in a jar
And everything is distant as the stars
I am here and you are where you are

We have lived a long time here in the forest
We lie beneath the heaps of leaves
We are partial to this partial light
We cannot sleep and fear our dreams
There is no order here, nothing can be planned
We are fireflies trapped in a little boy’s hand
And everything is distant as the stars
I am here and you are where you are

And we lie among our atoms and I speak to you of things
And hope sometimes that maybe you will understand
There is no order here and there is no middle ground
Nothing can be predicted and nothing can be planned
A star is just a memory of a star
We are fireflies pulsing dimly in the dark

2019,Ghosteen,11,Hollywood,,"The fires continued through the night
The kid with a bat face appeared at the window then disappeared into the headlights
I was halfway to the Pacific Coast
I had left you in your longing and your yearning like a ghost
There's little room for wonder now, and little room for wildness too
We crawl into our wounds, I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
I'm gonna buy me a house up in the hills
With a tear-shaped pool and a gun that kills
Cause they say there is a cougar that roams these parts
With a terrible engine of wrath for a heart
That she is white and rare and full of all kinds of harm
And stalks the perimeter all day long
But at night lays trembling in my arms

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my place in the sun
And I'm just waiting now, for peace to come

And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And I'm just waiting now, for my time to come
And we hide in our wounds and I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
And I know my time will come one day soon
I'm waiting for peace to come
And I'm nearly all the way to Malibu
Oh babe we're on the run, we're on the run, we're on the run
Halfway down the Pacific Coast
Well I left you sleeping like a ghost in your wounds
Darling your dreams are your greatest part
I carry them with me in my heart
Darling your dreams are your greatest part
I carry them with me in my heart
Somewhere, don't know

Now I'm standing on the shore
All the animals roam the beaches
Sea creatures rise out of the sea
And I'm standing on the shore
Everyone begins to run
The kid drops his bucket and spade
And climbs into the sun

Kisa had a baby, but the baby died
Goes to the villagers, says ""My baby's sick!""
Villagers shake their heads and say to her
""Better bury your baby in the forest quick""

It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind

Kisa went to the mountain and asked the Buddha
""My baby's sick!"" Buddha said, ""Don't cry""
""Go to each house and collect a mustard seed
But only from a house where no one's died""
Kisa went to each house in the village
""My baby's getting sicker"", poor Kisa cried
But Kisa never collected one mustard seed
Because every house, someone had died
Kisa sat down in the old village square
She hugged her baby and cried and cried
She said everybody is always losing somebody
Then walked into the forest and buried her child

Everybody's losing someone
Everybody's losing someone
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
It's a long way to find peace of mind, peace of mind
